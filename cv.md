1. My goal is to become a front-end development specialist. Yes, I have no experience in this and I am not quite young, but the skills acquired in other areas and my personal qualities, purposefulness, a strong desire to learn, self-develop, easy to adapt to different conditions, discipline, motivation, will help in achieving the goal.
